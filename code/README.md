The codes for the image processing methods presented in Yin et al., Nature Cell Biology 15, 860-871 (2013). 
Tools include nuclei segmentation, cell body segmentation, and extraction of 211 features to quantify the cell morphology.

Demo.m uses the example figures in the subfolder “Input” and generate segmentation and feature extraction results in the subfolder “Output”.

Codes validated for MatlabTM 7.1 (R14), and the corresponding version of Image Processing Toolbox for Matlab” is required.
