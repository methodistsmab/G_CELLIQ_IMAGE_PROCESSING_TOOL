Some matlab code to do shading correction by subtracting a spline surface 
which is iteratively fitted to the background using least squares.

The algorithm is published in

'A comparison of methods for estimation of intensity nonuniformities in
2D and 3D microscope images of fluorescence stained cells.',
In Proceedings of the 12th Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis
(SCIA), pages 264-271, Bergen, Norway, June 2001. 


Usage example:
    bg_compensate('img.tif','kde');
    bg_compensate('img.tif',1.7);

Iterative backgournd selecting code is in backgr.m
KDE backgournd selecting code is in kdebackgr.m

Spline code is in splinefit* and evalspline*
