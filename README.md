Morphological plasticity is critical to organism development as
exemplified by the reversible conversion of embryonic non-migratory
epithelial cells to motile mesenchymal cells required for tissue
positioning and organization1. The size of the shape space a cell has the
potential to explore reflects its morphological plasticity2. Highly plastic
cells explore large regions of shape space when compared with cells
with stable morphologies. In adult organisms, the shape space available
to most differentiated cells is relatively limited, serving to enforce tissue
architecture and function. However, during the pathogenesis of diseases
such as metastatic cancers, cells can re-acquire the ability to explore
shape space and thus find a shape that is suitable for migration and
invasion. At present, there is little understanding of how the size
and topology of cellular shape space is determined by genetic and
environmental factors.
To identify how genes contribute to the size and topology of shape
space we developed high-throughput imaging and computational
methods to describe the morphological complexity of cellular
populations and applied them to data sets generated by systematic
RNA interference (RNAi) screens in Drosophila Kc cells. We first
determined whether cells have discrete shapes or whether shape is a continuous variable. Subsequently we identified genes that contribute
to the exploration of shape space in Kc cells, as well as those that regulate
the topology of shape space itself. Finally we isolated a conserved gene
network that regulates contractility and protrusion in Drosophila as
well as mouse and human melanoma cells. This demonstrates that the
analysis of morphological complexity provides new insights into the
signalling networks regulating cell shape.
